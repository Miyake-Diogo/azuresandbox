## Overview

This module deploys Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) with both personal desktop and RemoteApp configurations. It creates a single shared workspace with two host pools and application groups. The personal desktop host pool provides full Windows desktop access (max 2 sessions), while the RemoteApp host pool streams individual applications like Microsoft Edge (max 10 sessions).

## Smoke Testing

* From the client environment, launch the [Windows App](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9N1F85V9T8BN?hl=en-us&gl=US&ocid=pdpshare)
* Sign in as the Azure CLI signed in user
* Connect to the sample desktop, then disconnect
* Connect to the sample Microsoft Edge RemoteApp, then disconnect
